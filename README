Ever wondered what a augmented 7th above A flat was, but wasn't sure how to
calculate it or wanted to make sure your answer was correct? This program is the
program for you! This calculator gives users the ability to calculate musical
intervals on the fly.

On UNIX systems, use the provided Makefile commands to compile, and run the
program with ./IntervalCalc to get your musical woes solved!


Windows users, compile how you normally would compile a java program with

javac -cp %JFUGUE_DIR%\jfugue.jar;. IntervalIdentifier.java

(replacing %JFUGUE_DIR% with the directory name where you have it saved)

and run with

java -cp %JFUGUE_DIR%\jfugue.jar;. IntervalIdentifier


I hope this project is of great use to you!

Later versions may include GUI representations of the intervals created, as well
as the intervals played in their respective musical tones! Stay tuned for that!

Email natebrowne@outlook.com with any suggestions, bugs, or ideas for the next
versions of this program!
