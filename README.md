# Interval Identifier
## Demystifying Music Theory, one Interval at a Time

### Intro

Ever wondered what an augmented 7th above A flat was, but wasn't sure how to
calculate it or wanted to make sure your answer was correct? This program is the
program for you! This calculator gives users the ability to calculate musical
intervals on the fly, as well as playing the new interval created back to the
user for them to hear what it sounds like.

### Usage

The program has been compiled, so all you have to do is navigate to the "bin"
directory and type `./IntervalCalc` from any command line!

I'm working on a GUI version that will be more convenient to use, so stay tuned.
