# Interval Identifier
## Demystifying Music Theory, one Interval at a Time

### Intro

Ever wondered what an augmented 7th above A flat was, but wasn't sure how to
calculate it or wanted to make sure your answer was correct? This program is the
program for you! This calculator gives users the ability to calculate musical
intervals on the fly, as well as playing the new interval created back to the
user for them to hear what it sounds like.

### Usage

To use this program, you'll need to make sure that you have (ant)[https://ant.apache.org].
You can use `ant compiletxt` and `ant compileGUI` inside of the main directory for this
project to build the executables for you! From there, you can run them by typing
`bin/IntervalCalc` or `bin/IntervalCalcGUI`.

I'll be creating a precompiled executable .jar file soon, so stay tuned!
